CMake Error at /opt/ros/humble/share/rcl_logging_spdlog/cmake/ament_cmake_export_dependencies-extras.cmake:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findspdlog.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "spdlog", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "spdlog" with any
  of the following names:

    spdlogConfig.cmake
    spdlog-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "spdlog" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "spdlog_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "spdlog"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
